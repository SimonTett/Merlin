Notes for mod to use CO2 from namelist when have interactive CO2. Goal being to suppress climate/carbon feedbacks so can
see impact of such feedbacks on FAMOUS.

Have variables L_CO2_3D & L_CO2_INTERACTIVE. I think there is a lack of consistency in use of these...

R2_SWRAD & R2_LWRAD  both get CO2_DIM1, CO2_DIM2, CO2_3D and L_CO2_3D passed in. With FIRST_POINT_CO2 used as pointer to first (??) CO2 point on the grid.
CO2_3D gets set by copying in data from D1 array.

Value is there in the namelist even though not visible in the UMUI.
So “Hack” would be to use this value (or actually whatever is the mean value for the Control). Which will need to be put in the namelist.

Then I think the hack is to replace
CO2_3D(I, LEVEL) = D1(JCO2(1)+POINT-1)                        ACN2F405.57
With
CO2_3D(I, LEVEL)= CO2_MMR



Experiment is xovfz.
Add Mod: xovdy
Ten year run.  Done
Set CO2_MMR to 8.8e-4 (double ref value).
Compiled and ran for 10 years.

So how to test?
1)	Put in a very high CO2_MMR in the namelist & run for 10 years
2)	Expect T to shoot up and Strat T to fall. Surface T goes up compared to reference.
  Strat T falls by ~5K in first year and then slowly rises -- preseumably coz getting more IR from trop
3)	But total Carbon to stay fairly constant – would expect an increase in Atmos C as land outgases.
  total C stays constant. AtmC increases, SoilC decreases. Small changes in OcC (+ve) and Veg C (-ve).

Overall behaving as expected. Will then run model for 500 years to get impulse response of the system with no carbon feedback to doubling CO2.
We can compute the additional forcing and so additional impact of temperature driven response...
Need a new control with CO2 set at  0.00044 (to 2 sf) and using mod. But we already have CO2 set to 4.4e-4 so not much needed there!

Setup and submitted two 1000 Pg Pulse simulations
xovf#k -- fixed CO2 off the end of the spinup.
xovd#k -- fixed CO2 of the fixed CO2 historical simulation. (xpvd#x).
